## Technologies 

Here is the technical stacks I used : 
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - SCSS
 - SASS
 - JavaSript 
 
SCSS was a really interesting discovery. The ability to nest the code makes it far more readable and easy to write. The mixin and variable are also nice features, but since CSS include variable natively, they were less impressive.
